# Day 3 - Statistical Analysis of Iris Dataset

**Objective:**  
Use statistical techniques to explore and compare features of the Iris dataset.

**Tasks Completed:**  
- Computed mean, median, and standard deviation for all features  
- Calculated grouped statistics by species  
- Conducted ANOVA test to determine significant differences  
- Visualized distributions using boxplots and histograms

**Key Insights:**  
- Petal features clearly differentiate species  
- Sepal features overlap more, indicating weaker separation  
- Statistical tests support insights for classification

**Technologies Used:**  
Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, SciPy
